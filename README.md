Compilation Instructions: Open Maven Panel --> CW2025 --> Plugins --> javafx --> javafx:run

Implemented and Working Properly: 
- Added a Restart Button after failing the level.
- Added Hard Drop with Space Bar
- Added Soft Drop
- Changed Block Spawning Position Higher

Implemented but Not Working Properly: 

Features Not Implemented:

New Java Classes:
PauseMenu.java

Modified Java Classes:
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane -> import javafx.geometry.Pos

Unexpected Problems: 
- Tried to add Ghost Blocks to show the location of a block before it is placed and it messed up my entire game. Blocks would spawn and place themselves in the air even after i resetted the changes. Had to delete my progress and start from scratch.
